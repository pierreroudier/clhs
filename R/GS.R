  # rstack: raster stack of environmental covariates

  # This MUST have one column named 'ID' of sample point names to name the output rasters
  # Buffer: numeric. Buffer distance around each point that similarity will be calculated. 
  # If buffer = 250 the final buffer will be 500 m in diameter.
  # fac: numeric, can be > 1, (e.g., fac = c(2,3)). Raster layer(s) which are categorical variables. Set to NA if no factor is present.
