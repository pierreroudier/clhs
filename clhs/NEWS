============ clhs_0.5-2 - 2012-09-10 ============
* version ready for release when ggplot2_0.9.2.1 is rolled out

============ clhs_0.5-1 - 2012-09-10 ============
* minor bugfix version fixing compatibility issues with ggplot2 >= 0.9.2
* added ggplot2 in Suggests temporarly to fix bug in ggplot2_0.9.2

============ clhs_0.5-0 - 2012-06-06 ============
* introduced cost and cost tracking modes
* general code cleaning
* improved plot function:
  - general buxfixes
  - now using dotplot for factors
  - support cost function
  - new boxplot mode
* cleaner NAMESPACE

============ clhs_0.4-3 - 2012-01-12 ============
* Dummy version increment to solve CRAN upload problems

============ clhs_0.4-2 - 2012-01-11 ============
* Added the choice between histogram and density plots in
the plot method

============ clhs_0.4-1 - 2012-01-11 ============
* Improved doc
* Complete plot.cLHS_result method using ggplot2
* new reshape2 dependency
* various buxfixes, esp. for spatial classes

============ clhs_0.4-0 - 2012-01-10 ============
* Introduced cLHS_result S3 class with associated plot method
* Introduced simple = ... option to the clhs() method. If set to true, returns only the indices of the selected samples, if set to FALSE, retuurns a cLHS_result object (eg if you want to plot the objective function behaviour).
* added a plot() method. For the moment, it just plots the objective function.

============ clhs_0.3-2 - 2011-10-18 ============
* slight improvement on the Raster method using rasterToPoints(...)
* added plotting option for the objective function

============ clhs_0.3-1 - 2011-10-18 ============
* Corrected bug on Raster* methods. Now returns a SpatialPointsDataFrame object.

============ clhs_0.3-0 - 2011-10-14 ============
* Switch to S4 methods
* Introduced methods for Raster* and SpatialP*DataFrame classes

============ clhs_0.2-1 - 2011-10-12 ============
* changed examples

============ clhs_0.2-0 - 2011-10-12 ============
* Fixed important bugs in the annealing process.

============ clhs_0.1-0 - 2011-10-07 ============
* Initial release of the package.
